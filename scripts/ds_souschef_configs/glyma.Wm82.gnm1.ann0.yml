  provenance: "The files in this directory originated from http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov. The Phytozome repository is considered the primary repository and authoritative; files in this present directory are derived, and may have changes, as noted below. The files here are held as part of the LegumeInfo and SoyBase projects, and are made available here for the purpose of reproducibility of analyses at these sites (e.g. gene family alignments and phylogenies, genome browsers, etc.) and for further use by researchers, as that research extends other analyses at the LegumeInfo and SoyBase projects. If you are conducting research on large-scale data sets for this species, please consider retrieving the data from the primary repositories. If you use the data in the present directory, please respect any usage restrictions in the present and original repositories, and cite the data appropriately."

  synopsis_genome: Glycine max accession Williams 82 genome assembly V1.0 (equal to V1.1), from PhytozomeV9/Gmax_189, released Sept 2012.
  synopsis_annot: Glycine max annotation V1.0 on accession Williams 82 genome assembly V1.0, from PhytozomeV8/Gmax_109, released Jan 2010. The annotations were updated in a later release, V1.1, on the same underlying genome.
  genotype: Wm82
  taxid: "3847"
  description_genome: "Genome assembly for Wm82, first assembly, released in 2010, as part of Phytozome V8."

  supercontig_prefix: scaffold_
  description_annot: "Gene annotation resources. See full description at Phytozome/JGI repository (address above). Note that this was the first annotation released for the V1.0 assembly of Wm82, released as part of Phytozome V8. This annotation was updated and replaced with V1.1, as part of Phytozome V9 in 2012. This annotation collection can be considered deprecated, but is retained as legacy data, in support of publications that referenced the gene models in the initial release."
