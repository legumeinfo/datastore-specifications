  provenance: "The files in this directory originated from http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov. The Phytozome repository is considered the primary repository and authoritative; files in this present directory are derived, and may have changes, as noted below. The files here are held as part of the LegumeInfo and SoyBase projects, and are made available here for the purpose of reproducibility of analyses at these sites (e.g. gene family alignments and phylogenies, genome browsers, etc.) and for further use by researchers, as that research extends other analyses at the LegumeInfo and SoyBase projects.

  description_genome: "This release is from a an accession from Ames, Iowa, registered as accession ISC494698. This accession derived originally from a population on the west side of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The resulting genome assembly was resolved into two haplotype assemblies. This collection is for haplotype 2. For full description of assembly methods and characteristics, see the Phytozome description at the URL above."
