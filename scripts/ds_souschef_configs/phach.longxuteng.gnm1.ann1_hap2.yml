  provenance: "The files in this directory originated from National Genomics Data Center (NGDC), for genome sequence GWHCBFY00000000.1, submitted by the Guangxi University in 2023-10-13. The GenBank source is considered the primary repository and authoritative; files in this present directory are derived, and may have changes, as noted below. The files here are held as part of the LegumeInfo and Peanutbase projects, and are made available here for the purpose of reproducibility of analyses at these sites (e.g. gene family alignments and phylogenies, genome browsers, etc.) and for further use by researchers, as that research extends other analyses at the LegumeInfo and Peanutbase projects. If you are conducting research on large-scale data sets for this species, please consider retrieving the data from the primary repositories. If you use the data in the present directory, please respect any usage restrictions in the present and original repositories, and cite the data appropriately."

  description_genome: "Genome assembly 1 for Phanera championii, accession longxuteng, with sequenced generated using PacBio-Sequel II; Illumina-sequenced Hi-C. Phanera championii, a perennial evergreen liana of the Fabaceae family, is widely distributed in the karst areas of Southwest China. Its well-developed root system and strong adaptability make it an ideal plant species for the ecological management of rock desertification. They performed high-coverage PacBio, Hi-C, and transcriptome sequencing of this highly heterozygous genome and obtained haplotype-resolved genomes."
