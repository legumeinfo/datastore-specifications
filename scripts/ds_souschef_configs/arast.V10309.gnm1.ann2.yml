    provenance: "The files in this directory originated from GenBank, for RefSeq genome sequence GCF_014773155.1, submitted by the International Peanut Genome Initiative in 2018. The GenBank source is considered the primary repository and authoritative; files in this present directory are derived, and may have changes, as noted below. The files here are held as part of the LegumeInfo and Peanutbase projects, and are made available here for the purpose of reproducibility of analyses at these sites (e.g. gene family alignments and phylogenies, genome browsers, etc.) and for further use by researchers, as that research extends other analyses at the LegumeInfo and Peanutbase projects. If you are conducting research on large-scale data sets for this species, please consider retrieving the data from the primary repositories. If you use the data in the present directory, please respect any usage restrictions in the present and original repositories, and cite the data appropriately."

    description_genome: "Genome assembly 1 for Arachis stenosperma, accession V10309, with sequenced generated using PacBio Sequel; Illumina HiSeq. Arachis stenosperma Krapov. & W.C. Greg. is a wild peanut relative native to central Brazil, in the past it was cultivated by native peoples of South America, and was carried to the Atlantic coast, where populations persist to the present day. It is a source of strong pest and disease resistance and has been used by peanut breeders and geneticists in interspecific hybrids. A. stenosperma is diploid species in the A-genome group of Arachis, which has similarity to the A genome of tetraploid cultivated peanut (A. hypogaea). This accession was sequenced with PacBio long reads, with contributions by USDA-ARS and researchers at Mars Inc. and the University of Georgia"
