    provenance: "The files in this directory originated from https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.573n5tbdr, submitted by Isabelle Massaro, Scott Poethig, Neelima Sinha, and Aaron Leichty in 2023. The Dryad source is considered the primary repository and authoritative; files in this present directory are derived, and may have changes, as noted below. The files here are held as part of the LegumeInfo, SoyBase, and Peanutbase projects, and are made available here for the purpose of reproducibility of analyses at these sites (e.g. gene family alignments and phylogenies, genome browsers, etc.) and for further use by researchers. If you are conducting research on large-scale data sets for this species, please consider retrieving the data from the primary repositories. If you use the data in the present directory, please respect any usage restrictions in the present and original repositories, and cite the data appropriately."

    description_genome: "Genome assembly 1 for Acacia crassicarpa, accession Acra3RX. Sequence reads were generated with PacBio Sequel and Illumina NextSeq. The genome were assembled using hifiasm using Omni-C reads to generate haplotype-resolved assemblies. The larger of the two haplotype assemblies was then used for scaffolding using SALSA and the Omni-C reads."
