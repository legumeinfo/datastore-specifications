    provenance: "The files in this directory originated from http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov. The Phytozome repository is considered the primary repository and authoritative; files in this present directory are derived, and may have changes, as noted below. The files here are held as part of the LegumeInfo and SoyBase projects, and are made available here for the purpose of reproducibility of analyses at these sites (e.g. gene family alignments and phylogenies, genome browsers, etc.) and for further use by researchers, as that research extends other analyses at the LegumeInfo and SoyBase projects.

    description_genome: "This release (Phaseolus coccineus var. PHA8298, Pc_12) was sequenced within the European project BEAN_ADAPT, in collaboration with the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. The BEAN_ADAPT projects, funded through the 2nd ERA-CAPS call, ERA-NET for Coordinating Action in Plant Science, was designed to investigate the genetic basis and phenotypic consequences of the adaptation to new environments of the common bean and its sister species, the runner bean, through the study of their introduction and expansion through Europe, as a recent and historically well-defined event of rapid adaptation. Please see https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Pcoccineus_v1_1 for additional information."
