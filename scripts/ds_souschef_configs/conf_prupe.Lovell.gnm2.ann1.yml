    provenance: "The files in this directory originated from http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov. The Phytozome repository is considered the primary repository and authoritative; files in this present directory are derived, and may have changes, as noted below. The files here are held as part of the LegumeInfo and SoyBase projects, and are made available here for the purpose of reproducibility of analyses at these sites (e.g. gene family alignments and phylogenies, genome browsers, etc.) and for further use by researchers, as that research extends other analyses at the LegumeInfo and SoyBase projects.

    synopsis_genome: Prunus persica (peach) accession Lovell, genome assembly 2, by the International Peach Genome Initiative
    synopsis_annot: Annotation 1 for peach accession Lovell, genome assembly 2
    genotype: Lovell
    taxid: "3760"
    description_genome: "Peach v2.0 was generated from DNA from the doubled haploid cultivar 'Lovell' (PLOV2-2N) which means that the genes and intervening DNA is fixed or identical for all alleles and both chromosomal copies of the genome. This doubled haploid nature has facilitated a highly accurate and consistent assembly of the peach genome. Peach v2.0 currently consists of 8 pseudomolecules representing the 8 chromosomes of peach, and are numbered according to their corresponding linkage groups. The genome sequencing consisted of approximately 8.47 fold whole genome shotgun sequencing employing the accurate Sanger methodology and was assembled using Arachne.
