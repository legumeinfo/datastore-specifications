# markers

This spec is mainly about the markers directory and filenames, since GFF3 files are already specified.

Directory name: *strain.gnm*.mrk.*source*

Filename: *gensp.strain.gnm*.mrk.*source*.gff3

*source* is typically the name of a SNP chip, e.g. Cowpea1MSelectedSNPs, and will be the same as the source column in the GFF.

README.*strain.gnm*.mrk.*source*.yml contains the normal README fields.
