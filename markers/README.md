# markers

Mappings of markers to genomes are provided in GFF files in directories under /markers/.

Directory name: *strain.gnm*.mrk.*source*

Filename: *gensp.strain.gnm*.mrk.*source*.gff3

*source* is typically the name of a SNP chip, e.g. Cowpea1MSelectedSNPs, and will be the same as the source column in the GFF.

README.*strain.gnm*.mrk.*source*.yml contains the normal README fields.
