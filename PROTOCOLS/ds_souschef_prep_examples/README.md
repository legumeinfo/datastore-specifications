# Examples of data-preparation protocols for preparing data from various sources.
Notes files in this directory show methods that have been used to prepare files for the Data Store,
transforming incoming data from e.g. GenBank or the CNCB Genome Warehouse (GWH).
Although the notes apply to particular data sets, they are meant to be useable with minimal modification
for similar datasets from these major data sources. Some effort has been made to keep the
notes generic, using variables wherever possible - and to test the notes carefully. Please report errors or questions.
