# Objective: Prepare a pangene collection for the Data Store

# See the document here for detailed (general) instructions:

This file contains notes for creating pangene collections for the Data Store. Read them critically, revise 
for your particular job, and copy-paste in an interactive terminal session. The file has a suffix ".sh" only 
 to get syntax highlighting in an editor (e.g. vim). It should not be executied as a shell script.

# Prepare config - step 1. To get the annotation lists for annotations_main and annotations_extra, run the following
# (the script is in /usr/local/www/data/datastore-specifications/scripts):
  pan_stats_to_annot_lists.awk $PRIVATE/$GENUS/GENUS/out_pandagma/stats.txt

# Prepare the config - step 2. This is best done by copying from a previous config file and modifying fields as needed.
  vim $CONFIGDIR/$GENUS.$PANNUM.yml

# Run ds_souschef.pl
  ds_souschef.pl -conf $CONFIGDIR/$GENUS.$PANNUM.yml

# NOTE: Check the results for sanity.
# The fasta files (cds, transcript, protein) should all have prefixes (gensp.genotype.gnm#.ann#.)
  echo "Testing for hashing correctness. Counts of UNDEFINED should be 0 in all files."
