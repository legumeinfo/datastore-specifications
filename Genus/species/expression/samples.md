# Samples file
Samples are provided in a multicolumn tab-delimited data file. Only the first two columns are required.
1. **sample name** (human-readable like Root Tip)
2. **sample identifier** (typically a BioProject accession like SRR1569474)
3. sample uniquename
4. sample description
5. treatment
6. tissue
7. development stage
8. age
9. organism (*Genus species*)
10. infraspecies
11. cultivar
12. application
13. sra_run
14. biosample_accession
15. sra_accession
16. bioproject_accession
17. sra_study
