## GWAS results file (results.tsv)
Filename: *gensp.population*.gwas.*Author1_Author2_year*.results.tsv

Note 1: GWAS results and other files from a GWAS are placed in a .gwas. directory, not a .gen. directory.

Note 2: GWAS results are associated with traits, not QTLs. (GWAS do not determine QTLs, they determine individual marker-trait associations with associated significance.)

GWAS results are presented in a file with three columns:
1. trait (e.g. Seed weight)
2. marker (e.g. Affx-152042939)
3. p-value (e.g. 9.12e-9)
