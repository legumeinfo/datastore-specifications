genus: Glycine
species: max
abbrev: glyma
commonName: soybean
description: "Soybean (Glycine max), the predominant oil-seed legume worldwide, was likely domesticated in East Asia, ~6000-9000 years ago (Sedivy et al., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.14418). It has many culinary and industrial uses. Some of the culinary uses include for direct consumption of the green seed (i.e. edamame) and leaves (cooked, much like spinach); for tofu, soymilk, textured vegetable protein, soy sauce, tempeh, natto, and vegetable oil. Industrial uses include oils, soap, cosmetics, and biodiesel. Soybean is also used as a high-protein forage, and can be prepared for fish- and animal-feed."

strains:
  - identifier: Wm82
    accession: PI 518671
    name: Williams 82
    accession_group: Reference - Williams 82
    origin: Northern United States
    description: "Williams 82 was derived from backcrossing a phytophthora root rot resistance locus from the donor parent Kingwa into the recurrent parent Williams. A sub-line, Wm82-ISU-01, was derived by Robert Stupar (University of Minnesota) by inbreeding original W82 seed. That sub-line, registered as PI 704477, was used for assembly Wm82.gnm6 / Wm82.a6."
  - identifier: Lee
    accession: PI 548656
    accession_group: Reference - Lee
    name: Lee
    origin: Southern United States
    description: "Cultivar Lee, which derives from a cross of Chinese lines CNS and S-100, has been widely used as a parent in many breeding projects in the Southern U.S. and in Brazil (Wysmierski and Vello, 2013; http://doi.org/10.1590/S1415-47572013005000041). The variety is notable for resistance to Phytophthora rot, Peanut Mottle Virus, and bacterial pustule (Wysmierski and Vello, 2013)."
