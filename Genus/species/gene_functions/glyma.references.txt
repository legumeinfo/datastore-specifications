AB  - E10 is a new maturity locus in soybean and FT4 is the predicted/potential 
      functional gene underlying the locus. Flowering and maturity time traits play 
      crucial roles in economic soybean production. Early maturity is critical for 
      north and west expansion of soybean in Canada. To date, 11 genes/loci have been 
      identified which control time to flowering and maturity; however, the molecular 
      bases of almost half of them are not yet clear. We have identified a new maturity 
      locus called "E10" located at the end of chromosome Gm08. The gene symbol E10e10 
      has been approved by the Soybean Genetics Committee. The e10e10 genotype results 
      in 5-10 days earlier maturity than E10E10. A set of presumed E10E10 and e10e10 
      genotypes was used to identify contrasting SSR and SNP haplotypes. These 
      haplotypes, and their association with maturity, were maintained through five 
      backcross generations. A functional genomics approach using a predicted 
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) approach (Protein-protein Interaction 
      Prediction Engine, PIPE) was used to investigate approximately 75 genes located 
      in the genomic region that SSR and SNP analyses identified as the location of the 
      E10 locus. The PPI analysis identified FT4 as the most likely candidate gene 
      underlying the E10 locus. Sequence analysis of the two FT4 alleles identified 
      three SNPs, in the 5'UTR, 3'UTR and fourth exon in the coding region, which 
      result in differential mRNA structures. Allele-specific markers were developed 
      for this locus and are available for soybean breeders to efficiently develop 
      earlier maturing cultivars using molecular marker assisted breeding.

AB  - Soybean is a major legume crop originating in temperate regions, and photoperiod 
      responsiveness is a key factor in its latitudinal adaptation. Varieties from 
      temperate regions introduced to lower latitudes mature early and have extremely 
      low grain yields. Introduction of the long-juvenile (LJ) trait extends the 
      vegetative phase and improves yield under short-day conditions, thereby enabling 
      expansion of cultivation in tropical regions. Here we report the cloning and 
      characterization of J, the major classical locus conferring the LJ trait, and 
      identify J as the ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3). J 
      depends genetically on the legume-specific flowering repressor E1, and J protein 
      physically associates with the E1 promoter to downregulate its transcription, 
      relieving repression of two important FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) genes and promoting 
      flowering under short days. Our findings identify an important new component in 
      flowering-time control in soybean and provide new insight into soybean adaptation 
      to tropical regions.

AB  - Adaptive changes in plant phenology are often considered to be a feature of the 
      so-called 'domestication syndrome' that distinguishes modern crops from their 
      wild progenitors, but little detailed evidence supports this idea. In soybean, a 
      major legume crop, flowering time variation is well characterized within 
      domesticated germplasm and is critical for modern production, but its importance 
      during domestication is unclear. Here, we identify sequential contributions of 
      two homeologous pseudo-response-regulator genes, Tof12 and Tof11, to ancient 
      flowering time adaptation, and demonstrate that they act via LHY homologs to 
      promote expression of the legume-specific E1 gene and delay flowering under long 
      photoperiods. We show that Tof12-dependent acceleration of maturity accompanied a 
      reduction in dormancy and seed dispersal during soybean domestication, possibly 
      predisposing the incipient crop to latitudinal expansion. Better understanding of 
      this early phase of crop evolution will help to identify functional variation 
      lost during domestication and exploit its potential for future crop improvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The timing of flowering has a direct impact on successful 
      seed production in plants. Flowering of soybean (Glycine max) is controlled by 
      several E loci, and previous studies identified the genes responsible for the 
      flowering loci E1, E2, E3 and E4. However, natural variation in these genes has 
      not been fully elucidated. The aims of this study were the identification of new 
      alleles, establishment of allele diagnoses, examination of allelic combinations 
      for adaptability, and analysis of the integrated effect of these loci on 
      flowering. METHODS: The sequences of these genes and their flanking regions were 
      determined for 39 accessions by primer walking. Systematic discrimination among 
      alleles was performed using DNA markers. Genotypes at the E1-E4 loci were 
      determined for 63 accessions covering several ecological types using DNA markers 
      and sequencing, and flowering times of these accessions at three sowing times 
      were recorded. KEY RESULTS: A new allele with an insertion of a long interspersed 
      nuclear element (LINE) at the promoter of the E1 locus (e1-re) was identified. 
      Insertion and deletion of 36 bases in the eighth intron (E2-in and E2-dl) were 
      observed at the E2 locus. Systematic discrimination among the alleles at the 
      E1-E3 loci was achieved using PCR-based markers. Allelic combinations at the 
      E1-E4 loci were found to be associated with ecological types, and about 62-66 % 
      of variation of flowering time could be attributed to these loci. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The study advances understanding of the combined roles of the E1-E4 loci in 
      flowering and geographic adaptation, and suggests the existence of unidentified 
      genes for flowering in soybean.

LID - 10.1093/jxb/erw283 [doi]
AB  - FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is an important floral integrator whose functions are 
      conserved across plant species. In soybean, two orthologs, FT2a and FT5a, play a 
      major role in initiating flowering. Their expression in response to different 
      photoperiods is controlled by allelic combinations at the maturity loci E1 to E4, 
      generating variation in flowering time among cultivars. We determined the 
      molecular basis of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for flowering time in linkage 
      group J (Chromosome 16). Fine-mapping delimited the QTL to a genomic region of 
      107kb that harbors FT5a We detected 15 DNA polymorphisms between parents with the 
      early-flowering (ef) and late-flowering (lf) alleles in the promoter region, an 
      intron, and the 3' untranslated region of FT5a, although the FT5a coding regions 
      were identical. Transcript abundance of FT5a was higher in near-isogenic lines 
      for ef than in those for lf, suggesting that different transcriptional activities 
      or mRNA stability caused the flowering time difference. Single-nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP) calling from re-sequencing data for 439 cultivated and wild 
      soybean accessions indicated that ef is a rare haplotype that is distinct from 
      common haplotypes including lf The ef allele at FT5a may play an adaptive role at 
      latitudes where early flowering is desirable.

AB  - Photoperiodism is a rhythmic change of sensitivity to light, which helps plants 
      to adjust flowering time according to seasonal changes in daylength and to adapt 
      to growing conditions at various latitudes. To reveal the molecular basis of 
      photoperiodism in soybean (Glycine max), a facultative short-day plant, we 
      analyzed the transcriptional profiles of the maturity gene E1 family and two 
      FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) orthologs (FT2a and FT5a). E1, a repressor for FT2a and 
      FT5a, and its two homologs, E1-like-a (E1La) and E1Lb, exhibited two peaks of 
      expression in long days. Using two different approaches (experiments with 
      transition between light and dark phases and night-break experiments), we 
      revealed that the E1 family genes were expressed only during light periods and 
      that their induction after dawn in long days required a period of light before 
      dusk the previous day. In the cultivar Toyomusume, which lacks the E1 gene, 
      virus-induced silencing of E1La and E1Lb up-regulated the expression of FT2a and 
      FT5a and led to early flowering. Therefore, E1, E1La, and E1Lb function similarly 
      in flowering. Regulation of E1 and E1L expression by light was under the control 
      of E3 and E4, which encode phytochrome A proteins. Our data suggest that 
      phytochrome A-mediated transcriptional induction of E1 and its homologs by light 
      plays a critical role in photoperiodic induction of flowering in soybean.

AB  - FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is a key flowering integrator in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis 
      thaliana), with homologs that encode florigens in many plant species regardless 
      of the type of photoperiodic response. We identified 10 FT homologs, which were 
      arranged as five pairs of linked genes in different homoeologous chromosomal 
      regions, in soybean (Glycine max), a paleopolyploid species. Two of the FT 
      homologs, GmFT2a and GmFT5a, were highly up-regulated under short-day (SD) 
      conditions (inductive for flowering in soybean) and had diurnal expression 
      patterns with the highest expression 4 h after dawn. Under long-day (LD) 
      conditions, expression of GmFT2a and GmFT5a was down-regulated and did not follow 
      a diurnal pattern. Flowering took much longer to initiate under LD than under SD, 
      and only the GmFT5a transcript accumulated late in development under LD. Ectopic 
      expression analysis in Arabidopsis confirmed that both GmFT2a and GmFT5a had the 
      same function as Arabidopsis FT, but the effect of GmFT5a was more prominent. A 
      double-mutant soybean line for two PHYTOCHROME A (PHYA) genes expressed high 
      levels of GmFT2a and GmFT5a under LD, and it flowered slightly earlier under LD 
      than the wild type grown under SD. The expression levels of GmFT2a and GmFT5a 
      were regulated by the PHYA-mediated photoperiodic regulation system, and the 
      GmFT5a expression was also regulated by a photoperiod-independent system in LD. 
      Taken together, our results suggest that GmFT2a and GmFT5a coordinately control 
      flowering and enable the adaptation of soybean to a wide range of photoperiodic 
      environments.

AB  - Gene duplication provides resources for novel gene functions. Identification of 
      the amino acids responsible for functional conservation and divergence of 
      duplicated genes will strengthen our understanding of their evolutionary course. 
      Here, we conducted a systemic functional investigation of 
      phosphatidylethanolamine binding proteins (PEBPs) in soybean (Glycine max) and 
      Arabidopsis thaliana. Our results demonstrated that after the ancestral 
      duplication, the lineage of the common ancestor of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and 
      TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) subfamilies functionally diverged from the MOTHER OF FT 
      AND TFL1 (MFT) subfamily to activate flowering and repress flowering, 
      respectively. They also underwent further specialization after subsequent 
      duplications. Although the functional divergence increased with duplication age, 
      we observed rapid functional divergence for a few pairs of young duplicates in 
      soybean. Association analysis between amino acids and functional variations 
      identified critical amino acid residues that led to functional differences in 
      PEBP members. Using transgenic analysis, we validated a subset of these 
      differences. We report clear experimental evidence for the functional evolution 
      of the PEBPs in the MFT, FT, and TFL1 subfamilies, which predate the origin of 
      angiosperms. Our results highlight the role of amino acid divergence in driving 
      evolutionary novelty after duplication.

TI  - EARLY FLOWERING 5 acts as a floral repressor in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 664-72
AB  - EARLY FLOWERING 5 (ELF5) is a single-copy gene involved in flowering time 
      regulation in Arabidopsis. ELF5 encodes a nuclear-targeted protein that is 
      related to the human nuclear protein containing a WW domain (Npw)38-binding 
      protein (NpwBP). Lesions in ELF5 cause early flowering in both long days and 
      short days. elf5 mutations partially suppress the late flowering of both 
      autonomous-pathway mutants and FRIGIDA (FRI)-containing lines by reducing the 
      expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a floral repressor upon which many of the 
      flowering pathways converge. elf5 mutations also partially suppress 
      photoperiod-pathway mutants, and this, along with the ability of elf5 mutations 
      to cause early flowering in short days, indicates that ELF5 also affects 
      flowering independently of FLC.

AB  - Photoperiodic flowering is one of the most important factors affecting regional 
      adaptation and yield in soybean (Glycine max). Plant adaptation to long-day 
      conditions at higher latitudes requires early flowering and a reduction or loss 
      of photoperiod sensitivity; adaptation to short-day conditions at lower latitudes 
      involves delayed flowering, which prolongs vegetative growth for maximum yield 
      potential. Due to the influence of numerous major loci and quantitative trait 
      loci (QTLs), soybean has broad adaptability across latitudes. Forward genetic 
      approaches have uncovered the molecular basis for several of these major maturity 
      genes and QTLs. Moreover, the molecular characterization of orthologs of 
      Arabidopsis thaliana flowering genes has enriched our understanding of the 
      photoperiodic flowering pathway in soybean. Building on early insights into the 
      importance of the photoreceptor phytochrome A, several circadian clock components 
      have been integrated into the genetic network controlling flowering in soybean: 
      E1, a repressor of FLOWERING LOCUS T orthologs, plays a central role in this 
      network. Here, we provide an overview of recent progress in elucidating 
      photoperiodic flowering in soybean, how it contributes to our fundamental 
      understanding of flowering time control, and how this information could be used 
      for molecular design and breeding of high-yielding soybean cultivars.

AB  - Soybean flowering and maturation are strictly regulated by photoperiod. 
      Photoperiod-sensitive soybean varieties can undergo flowering reversion when 
      switched from short-day (SD) to long-day (LD) conditions, suggesting the presence 
      of a 'floral-inhibitor' under LD conditions. We combined gene expression 
      profiling with a study of transgenic plants and confirmed that GmFT1a, soybean 
      Flowering Locus T (FT) homolog, is a floral inhibitor. GmFT1a is expressed 
      specifically in leaves, similar to the flowering-promoting FT homologs GmFT2a/5a. 
      However, in Zigongdongdou (ZGDD), a model variety for studying flowering 
      reversion, GmFT1a expression was induced by LD but inhibited by SD conditions. 
      This was unexpected, as it is the complete opposite of the expression of 
      flowering promoters GmFT2a/5a. Moreover, the key soybean maturity gene E1 may 
      up-regulate GmFT1a expression. It is also notable that GmFT1a expression was 
      conspicuously high in late-flowering varieties. Transgenic overexpression of 
      GmFT1a delayed flowering and maturation in soybean, confirming that GmFT1a 
      functions as a flowering inhibitor. This discovery highlights the complex impacts 
      of the functional diversification of the FT gene family in soybean, and implies 
      that antagonism between flowering-inhibiting and flowering-promoting FT homologs 
      in this highly photoperiod-sensitive plant may specify vegetative vs reproductive 
      development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: CO and FT orthologs, belonging to the BBX and PEBP family, 
      respectively, have important and conserved roles in the photoperiod regulation of 
      flowering time in plants. Soybean genome experienced at least three rounds of 
      whole genome duplications (WGDs), which resulted in multiple copies of about 75% 
      of genes. Subsequent subfunctionalization is the main fate for paralogous gene 
      pairs during the evolutionary process. RESULTS: The phylogenic relationships 
      revealed that CO orthologs were widespread in the plant kingdom while FT 
      orthologs were present only in angiosperms. Twenty-eight CO homologous genes and 
      twenty-four FT homologous genes were gained in the soybean genome. Based on the 
      collinear relationship, the soybean ancestral CO ortholog experienced three WGD 
      events, but only two paralogous gene pairs (GmCOL1/2 and GmCOL5/13) survived in 
      the modern soybean. The paralogous gene pairs, GmCOL1/2 or GmCOL5/13, showed 
      similar expression patterns in pair but different between pairs, indicating that 
      they functionally diverged. GmFTL1 to 7 were derived from the same ancestor prior 
      to the whole genome triplication (WGT) event, and after the Legume WGD event the 
      ancestor diverged into two branches, GmFTL3/5/7 and GmFTL1/2/4/6. GmFTL7 were 
      truncated in the N-terminus compared to other FT-lineage genes, but ubiquitously 
      expressed. Expressions of GmFTL1 to 6 were higher in leaves at the flowering 
      stage than that at the seedling stage. GmFTL3 was expressed at the highest level 
      in all tissues except roots at the seedling stage, and its circadian pattern was 
      different from the other five ones. The transcript of GmFTL6 was highly 
      accumulated in seedling roots. The circadian rhythms of GmCOL5/13 and 
      GmFT1/2/4/5/6 were synchronized in a day, demonstrating the complicate 
      relationship of CO-FT regulons in soybean leaves. Over-expression of GmCOL2 did 
      not rescue the flowering phenotype of the Arabidopsis co mutant. However, ectopic 
      expression of GmCOL5 did rescue the co mutant phenotype. All GmFTL1 to 6 showed 
      flower-promoting activities in Arabidopsis. CONCLUSIONS: After three recent 
      rounds of whole genome duplications in the soybean, the paralogous genes of CO-FT 
      regulons showed subfunctionalization through expression divergence. Then, only 
      GmCOL5/13 kept flowering-promoting activities, while GmFTL1 to 6 contributed to 
      flowering control. Additionally, GmCOL5/13 and GmFT1/2/3/4/5/6 showed similar 
      circadian expression profiles. Therefore, our results suggested that GmCOL5/13 
      and GmFT1/2/3/4/5/6 formed the complicate CO-FT regulons in the photoperiod 
      regulation of flowering time in soybean.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the molecular mechanisms of flowering and maturity is 
      important for improving the adaptability and yield of seed crops in different 
      environments. In soybean, a facultative short-day plant, genetic variation at 
      four maturity genes, E1 to E4, plays an important role in adaptation to 
      environments with different photoperiods. However, the molecular basis of natural 
      variation in time to flowering and maturity is poorly understood. Using a cross 
      between early-maturing soybean cultivars, we performed a genetic and molecular 
      study of flowering genes. The progeny of this cross segregated for two maturity 
      loci, E1 and E9. The latter locus was subjected to detailed molecular analysis to 
      identify the responsible gene. RESULTS: Fine mapping, sequencing, and expression 
      analysis revealed that E9 is FT2a, an ortholog of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T. 
      Regardless of daylength conditions, the e9 allele was transcribed at a very low 
      level in comparison with the E9 allele and delayed flowering. Despite identical 
      coding sequences, a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms and 
      insertions/deletions were detected in the promoter, untranslated regions, and 
      introns between the two cultivars. Furthermore, the e9 allele had a 
      Ty1/copia-like retrotransposon, SORE-1, inserted in the first intron. Comparison 
      of the expression levels of different alleles among near-isogenic lines and 
      photoperiod-insensitive cultivars indicated that the SORE-1 insertion attenuated 
      FT2a expression by its allele-specific transcriptional repression. SORE-1 was 
      highly methylated, and did not appear to disrupt FT2a RNA processing. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The soybean maturity gene E9 is FT2a, and its recessive allele 
      delays flowering because of lower transcript abundance that is caused by 
      allele-specific transcriptional repression due to the insertion of SORE-1. The 
      FT2a transcript abundance is thus directly associated with the variation in 
      flowering time in soybean. The e9 allele may maintain vegetative growth in 
      early-flowering genetic backgrounds, and also be useful as a long-juvenile 
      allele, which causes late flowering under short-daylength conditions, in 
      low-latitude regions.

AB  - The major maturity gene E1 has the most prominent effect on flowering time and 
      photoperiod sensitivity of soybean, but the pathway mediated by E1 is largely 
      unknown. Here, we found the expression of GmFT4, a homolog of Flowering Locus T, 
      was strongly up-regulated in transgenic soybean overexpressing E1, whereas 
      expression of flowering activators, GmFT2a and GmFT5a, was suppressed. GmFT4 
      expression was strongly up-regulated by long days exhibiting a diurnal rhythm, 
      but down-regulated by short days. Notably, the basal expression level of GmFT4 
      was elevated when transferred to continous light, whereas repressed when 
      transferred to continuous dark. GmFT4 was primarily expressed in fully expanded 
      leaves. Transcript abundance of GmFT4 was significantly correlated with that of 
      functional E1, as well as flowering time phenotype in different cultivars. 
      Overexpression of GmFT4 delayed the flowering time in transgenic Arabidopsis. 
      Taken together, we propose that GmFT4 acts downstream of E1 and functions as a 
      flowering repressor, and the balance of two antagonistic factors (GmFT4 vs 
      GmFT2a/5a) determines the flowering time of soybean.

AB  - FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is the key flowering integrator in Arabidopsis 
      (Arabidopsis thaliana), and its homologs encode florigens in many plant species 
      regardless of their photoperiodic response. Two FT homologs, GmFT2a and GmFT5a, 
      are involved in photoperiod-regulated flowering and coordinately control 
      flowering in soybean. However, the molecular and genetic understanding of the 
      roles played by GmFT2a and GmFT5a in photoperiod-regulated flowering in soybean 
      is very limited. In this study, we demonstrated that GmFT2a and GmFT5a were able 
      to promote early flowering in soybean by overexpressing these two genes in the 
      soybean cultivar Williams 82 under noninductive long-day (LD) conditions. The 
      soybean homologs of several floral identity genes, such as GmAP1, GmSOC1 and 
      GmLFY, were significantly upregulated by GmFT2a and GmFT5a in a redundant and 
      differential pattern. A bZIP transcription factor, GmFDL19, was identified as 
      interacting with both GmFT2a and GmFT5a, and this interaction was confirmed by 
      yeast two-hybridization and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). The 
      overexpression of GmFDL19 in soybean caused early flowering, and the 
      transcription levels of the flowering identity genes were also upregulated by 
      GmFDL19, as was consistent with the upregulation of GmFT2a and GmFT5a. The 
      transcription of GmFDL19 was also induced by GmFT2a. The results of the 
      electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) indicated that GmFDL19 was able to 
      bind with the cis-elements in the promoter of GmAP1a. Taken together, our results 
      suggest that GmFT2a and GmFT5a redundantly and differentially control 
      photoperiod-regulated flowering in soybean through both physical interaction with 
      and transcriptional upregulation of the bZIP transcription factor GmFDL19, 
      thereby inducing the expression of floral identity genes.

AB  - The FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene is a highly conserved florigen gene among 
      flowering plants. Soybean genome encodes six homologs of FT, which display 
      flowering activity in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, their contributions to 
      flowering time in different soybean cultivars, especially in field conditions, 
      are unclear. We employed six soybean cultivars with different maturities to 
      extensively investigate expression patterns of GmFTLs (Glycine max FT-like) and 
      GmCOLs (Glycine max CO-like) in the field conditions. The results show that 
      GmFTL3 is an FT homolog with the highest transcript abundance in soybean, but 
      other GmFTLs may also contribute to flower induction with different extents, 
      because they have more or less similar expression patterns in developmental-, 
      leaf-, and circadian-specific modes. And four GmCOL genes (GmCOL1/2/5/13) may 
      confer to the expression of GmFTL genes. Artificial manipulation of GmFTL 
      expression by transgenic strategy (overexpression and RNAi) results in a distinct 
      change in soybean flowering time, indicating that GmFTLs not only impact on the 
      control of flowering time, but have potential applications in the manipulation of 
      photoperiodic adaptation in soybean. Additionally, transgenic plants show that 
      GmFTLs play a role in formation of the first flowers and in vegetative growth.

AB  - Photosensitivity plays an essential role in the response of plants to their 
      changing environments throughout their life cycle. In soybean [Glycine max (L.) 
      Merrill], several associations between photosensitivity and maturity loci are 
      known, but only limited information at the molecular level is available. The FT3 
      locus is one of the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for flowering time that 
      corresponds to the maturity locus E3. To identify the gene responsible for this 
      QTL, a map-based cloning strategy was undertaken. One phytochrome A gene 
      (GmPhyA3) was considered a strong candidate for the FT3 locus. Allelism tests and 
      gene sequence comparisons showed that alleles of Misuzudaizu (FT3/FT3; JP28856) 
      and Harosoy (E3/E3; PI548573) were identical. The GmPhyA3 alleles of Moshidou 
      Gong 503 (ft3/ft3; JP27603) and L62-667 (e3/e3; PI547716) showed weak or complete 
      loss of function, respectively. High red/far-red (R/FR) long-day conditions 
      enhanced the effects of the E3/FT3 alleles in various genetic backgrounds. 
      Moreover, a mutant line harboring the nonfunctional GmPhyA3 flowered earlier than 
      the original Bay (E3/E3; PI553043) under similar conditions. These results 
      suggest that the variation in phytochrome A may contribute to the complex systems 
      of soybean flowering response and geographic adaptation.

AB  - Flowering is indicative of the transition from vegetative to reproductive phase, 
      a critical event in the life cycle of plants. In soybean (Glycine max), a 
      flowering quantitative trait locus, FT2, corresponding to the maturity locus E2, 
      was detected in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the varieties 
      "Misuzudaizu" (ft2/ft2; JP28856) and "Moshidou Gong 503" (FT2/FT2; JP27603). A 
      map-based cloning strategy using the progeny of a residual heterozygous line 
      (RHL) from the RIL was employed to isolate the gene responsible for this 
      quantitative trait locus. A GIGANTEA ortholog, GmGIa (Glyma10g36600), was 
      identified as a candidate gene. A common premature stop codon at the 10th exon 
      was present in the Misuzudaizu allele and in other near isogenic lines (NILs) 
      originating from Harosoy (e2/e2; PI548573). Furthermore, a mutant line harboring 
      another premature stop codon showed an earlier flowering phenotype than the 
      original variety, Bay (E2/E2; PI553043). The e2/e2 genotype exhibited elevated 
      expression of GmFT2a, one of the florigen genes that leads to early flowering. 
      The effects of the E2 allele on flowering time were similar among NILs and 
      constant under high (43 degrees N) and middle (36 degrees N) latitudinal regions in Japan. These 
      results indicate that GmGIa is the gene responsible for the E2 locus and that a 
      null mutation in GmGIa may contribute to the geographic adaptation of soybean.

AB  - Photoperiodic flowering, a plant response to seasonal photoperiod changes in the 
      control of reproductive transition, is an important agronomic trait that has been 
      a central target of crop domestication and modern breeding programs. However, our 
      understanding about the molecular mechanisms of photoperiodic flowering 
      regulation in crop species is lagging behind. To better understand the regulatory 
      gene networks controlling photoperiodic flowering of soybeans, we elucidated 
      global gene expression patterns under different photoperiod regimes using the 
      near isogenic lines (NILs) of maturity loci (E loci). Transcriptome signatures 
      identified the unique roles of the E loci in photoperiodic flowering and a set of 
      genes controlled by these loci. To elucidate the regulatory gene networks 
      underlying photoperiodic flowering regulation, we developed the network inference 
      algorithmic package CausNet that integrates sparse linear regression and Granger 
      causality heuristics, with Gaussian approximation of bootstrapping to provide 
      reliability scores for predicted regulatory interactions. Using the transcriptome 
      data, CausNet inferred regulatory interactions among soybean flowering genes. 
      Published reports in the literature provided empirical verification for several 
      of CausNet's inferred regulatory interactions. We further confirmed the inferred 
      regulatory roles of the flowering suppressors GmCOL1a and GmCOL1b using GmCOL1 
      RNAi transgenic soybean plants. Combinations of the alleles of GmCOL1 and the 
      major maturity locus E1 demonstrated positive interaction between these genes, 
      leading to enhanced suppression of flowering transition. Our work provides novel 
      insights and testable hypotheses in the complex molecular mechanisms of 
      photoperiodic flowering control in soybean and lays a framework for de novo 
      prediction of biological networks controlling important agronomic traits in 
      crops.

AB  - The general concept of photoperiodism, i.e., the photoperiodic induction of 
      flowering, was established by Garner and Allard (1920). The genetic factor 
      controlling flowering time, maturity, or photoperiodic responses was observed in 
      soybean soon after the discovery of the photoperiodism. E1, E2, and E3 were named 
      in 1971 and, thereafter, genetically characterized. At the centennial celebration 
      of the discovery of photoperiodism in soybean, we recount our endeavors to 
      successfully decipher the molecular bases for the major maturity loci E1, E2, and 
      E3 in soybean. Through systematic efforts, we successfully cloned the E3 gene in 
      2009, the E2 gene in 2011, and the E1 gene in 2012. Recently, successful 
      identification of several circadian-related genes such as PRR3a, LUX, and J has 
      enriched the known major E1-FTs pathway. Further research progresses on the 
      identification of new flowering and maturity-related genes as well as coordinated 
      regulation between flowering genes will enable us to understand profoundly 
      flowering gene network and determinants of latitudinal adaptation in soybean.

AB  - Adaptation of soybean cultivars to the photoperiod in which they are grown is 
      critical for optimizing plant yield. However, despite its importance, only the 
      major loci conferring variation in flowering time and maturity of US soybean have 
      been isolated. By contrast, over 200 genes contributing to floral induction in 
      the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana have been described. In this work, 
      putative alleles of a library of soybean orthologs of these Arabidopsis flowering 
      genes were tested for their latitudinal distribution among elite US soybean lines 
      developed in the United States. Furthermore, variants comprising the alleles of 
      genes with significant differences in latitudinal distribution were assessed for 
      amino acid conservation across disparate genera to infer their impact on gene 
      function. From these efforts, several candidate genes from various biological 
      pathways were identified that are likely being exploited toward adaptation of US 
      soybean to various maturity groups.
