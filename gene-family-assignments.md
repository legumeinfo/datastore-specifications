# Gene Family Assignments

Gene family assignments are represented in a single GFA file (per family set, e.g. against legfed_v1_0) in the appropriate annotations directory.

Filename: *gensp.strain.gnm.ann.KEY4.genefamilyversion.KEY4*.gfa.tsv

The file has five tab-delimited columns. All but the fifth are required.

1. **gene ID** (full LIS identifier of the gene)
1. **gene family ID** (LIS identifier of the gene family)
1. **protein ID** (full LIS identifier of the protein)
1. **e-value** (statistical significance of the assignment)
1. score (optional score value)

Example: phalu.G27455.gnm1.ann1.JD7C.legfed_v1_0.M65K.gfa.tsv
