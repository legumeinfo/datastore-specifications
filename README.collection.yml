description: "In this study, we analyzed the genetics of leaf morphology in a segregating cowpea RIL population, Sanzi (sub-globose) x Vita 7 (hastate). A QTL was identified for the “hastate leaf shape” locus, Hls, which was positioned on the cowpea consensus genetic map and cowpea physical map. A candidate gene was identified using syntenic relationships between cowpea, soybean and Medicago. In addition, a SNP marker was found which co-segregated with the leaf morphology genotypes and phenotype, which could be used as a molecular marker for breeding purposes."
